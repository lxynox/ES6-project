# ES6-project :bowling:
Setup new project using ES6 features. Babel + jspm/npm + node + gulp + grunt + karma + mocha(test)

## Technology Stack
- **babel**: ES6 transpiler(deragde es6 to es5)
- **jspm**: Application package manager(install packages for app's runtime)
- **npm**: Development package manager(install packages for dev's use, mainly testing, scaffolding and task scheduling) 
- **systemJS**: Global module loader for the browser stack and application bundler
- **gulp**: Build system and task scheduling tool
- **karma + mocha**: Testing frameworks

## Setup steps 
```bash
$ cd $repo
$ npm install
$ npm run jspm --install
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

## TODO
- [ ] add React routing for more elegant Url mapping
- [ ] setup linting as build task
- [ ] use Alt/Flux as the project architecture
- [ ] setup karma, mocha for the test environment
- [ ] consider 'webpack' as the single bundling/building tool instead of 'jspm+gulp'
- [x] use React, jQuery etc
